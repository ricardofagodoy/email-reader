### Why the hell Kotlin? ###

* It's cool
* It shines
* [Advantages listed bellow](https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3)

### Kotlin advantages ###

* Null safety
* Lean and clean syntax
* No checked exeptions
* Immutable data classes
* Functional programming support
* Extension (like Decorator)
* And so on...

### But I use Java ###

* Kotlin compile to JVM bytecode
* No runtime overhead
* Targets Java 1.6

### Kotlin for the win? ###

It's new and has many issues. I'm just learning so feel free to correct me if i'm wrong.
